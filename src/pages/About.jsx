        Greetings,
        <br />
        <br />
        I am YiÄŸit, a Front End Developer hailing from Istanbul, Turkey. I take
        pride in presenting an application that showcases my expertise in
        ReactJS, exemplifying my capabilities as a skilled developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Typerapid represents a dynamic speed typing game that challenges players
        to achieve peak performance by accurately typing words before they
        elapse from the screen. Adding to the complexity, words gradually
        increase in size and velocity as players advance through the game,
        testing and enhancing their typing agility. Furthermore, we encourage
        you to record your scores, securing your place on the leaderboard, and
        enabling you to engage in friendly competition with your peers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to any feedback
        or inquiries you may have.
      </p>
